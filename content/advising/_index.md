## I Am Considering A Minor

You have a few options inside the business school if you have a Finance Major.

The fastest one is a Minor in [Econ](https://kean.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2025-2026/undergraduate-catalog/colleges-programs-by-college/college-of-business-and-public-management/department-of-marketing-global-business-and-economics/economics/economics-minor/) - you will only need two more courses in addition to those required for your finance major.

Other options include a Minor in [Management](https://kean.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2025-2026/undergraduate-catalog/colleges-programs-by-college/college-of-business-and-public-management/department-of-management/management/management-minor/), [Marketing](https://kean.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2025-2026/undergraduate-catalog/colleges-programs-by-college/college-of-business-and-public-management/department-of-marketing-global-business-and-economics/marketing/marketing-minor/), or [Accounting](https://kean.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2025-2026/undergraduate-catalog/colleges-programs-by-college/college-of-business-and-public-management/department-of-accounting-and-finance/accounting/accounting-minor/).

If you are a non-Finance Major, you may consider the Minor in [Finance](https://kean.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2025-2026/undergraduate-catalog/colleges-programs-by-college/college-of-business-and-public-management/department-of-accounting-and-finance/finance/finance-minor/) or the newly developed Minor in [Fintech](https://kean.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2025-2026/undergraduate-catalog/colleges-programs-by-college/college-of-business-and-public-management/department-of-accounting-and-finance/finance/fintech-minor/).
