Since joining Kean University, I have developed and taught multiple courses for undergraduate students. These courses cover a range of topics, from introductory finance concepts to advanced subjects such as investments, exchange-traded funds, international business, and the application of finance concepts using Excel and Bloomberg. In the fall of 2025, I will be teaching a new course on utilizing Python in finance.
